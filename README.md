# Redis

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis provides data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

## About Azure Cache for Redis

Azure Cache for Redis provides an in-memory data store based on the [Redis](https://redis.io/). Redis improves the performance and scalability of an application that uses backend data stores heavily. 

Azure Cache for Redis offers both the Redis open-source (OSS Redis) and a commercial product from Redis Labs (Redis Enterprise) as a managed service. This service is operated by Microsoft, hosted on Azure, and usable by any application within or outside of Azure.

Azure Cache for Redis can be used as a distributed data or content cache, a session store, a message broker, and more. It can be deployed as a standalone. Or, it can be deployed along with other Azure database services, such as Azure SQL or Cosmos DB.
